# 242. Valid Anagram
[Visit this problem][1]

Given two strings s and t, write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.

For example,
> s = "anagram", t = "nagaram", return true.
> s = "rat", t = "car", return false.

Note:
You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.

Follow up:
What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?


Soluion1:
Counting each char shown in the string s and t,then comparing the shown times.
Of course,we can revise the way slightly just like solution1.cpp
